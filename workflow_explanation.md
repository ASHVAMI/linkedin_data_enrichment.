LinkedIn Data Enrichment Project: Workflow Explanation

Overview:
This document provides a detailed explanation of the workflow for the LinkedIn Data Enrichment project, including the database schema and key considerations made during implementation.

Workflow:
The project follows these main steps:

Data Extraction:
The system connects to an SQL database containing company information.
It retrieves the company_id and company_linkedin_url for each company.

Data Enrichment:
For each company, the system sends a request to the LinkedIn Bulk Data Scraper API.
The API returns detailed information about the company.
The system filters out any data points where the key contains 'affiliatedOrganizations', 'locations', or 'similarOrganizations'.

Data Storage:
The enriched data is stored in a new table in the database.

Database Schema:
The database consists of two main tables:
1. Companies Table
This table stores the basic company information:
sqlCopyCREATE TABLE companies (
    company_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    company_linkedin_url TEXT
);

2. Enriched Companies Table
This table stores the enriched data retrieved from the LinkedIn API:
sqlCopyCREATE TABLE enriched_companies (
    company_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    industry TEXT,
    website TEXT,
    company_size TEXT,
    founded TEXT,
    specialties TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies (company_id)
);
Key Considerations and Assumptions

API Rate Limiting:
Assumption: The LinkedIn Bulk Data Scraper API has rate limits.
Consideration: Implemented error handling and potential retry logic to manage API request failures.

Data Integrity:
Assumption: The company_id in the original database is unique and consistent.
Consideration: Used company_id as the primary key in both tables to maintain data integrity.

Data Filtering:
Requirement: Ignore data points with keys containing 'affiliatedOrganizations', 'locations', or 'similarOrganizations'.
Implementation: Applied filtering logic in the LinkedInScraper class before returning the enriched data.

Database Choice:
Consideration: Used SQLite for simplicity and portability, but the system can be easily adapted to other SQL databases.

Error Handling:
Consideration: Implemented comprehensive error handling to manage potential issues with database connections, API requests, and data processing.

Scalability:
Consideration: The current implementation processes companies sequentially. For larger datasets, consider implementing parallel processing or batch operations.

Security:
Consideration: API keys and database credentials are stored in configuration files. In a production environment, these should be managed more securely (e.g., environment variables, secret management systems).

Testing:
Consideration: Implemented unit tests for critical components (database operations and API interactions) to ensure reliability.

Future Enhancements:
Implement logging for better traceability of the enrichment process.
Add data validation to ensure the quality of enriched data before storage.
Implement a mechanism to update existing enriched data periodically.
Consider adding a user interface for easier interaction with the system.

This workflow is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy modifications and improvements as needed.
